## Create a banking management system where-

User ⇒
Can create an account with his/her name, email, address and account Type(Mainly Two Types: Savings & Cuurent).  
Initially, the balance will be 0. An account number will be generated automatically.  
Can deposit and withdraw amount. If the withdrawal amount is more than the current balance, show an error message that “Withdrawal amount exceeded”  
Can check available balance.  
Can check transaction history.  
Can take a loan from the bank at most two times.  
Can transfer the amount from his account to another user account. if the other account does not exist then show an error message “Account does not exist”.  
Note - User can only withdraw and transfer money from his account if he has money in his account.
If a user is unable to withdraw the amount of money he has deposited in the bank, he will get a message that the bank is bankrupt.

Admin⇒  
Can create an account  
Can delete any user account  
Can see all user accounts list  
Can check the total available balance of the bank.  
Can check the total loan amount.  
Can on or off the loan feature of the bank.

Now make a replica system so that an user and an admin can do the above tasks.
